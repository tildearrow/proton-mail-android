# ProtonMail for Google Play Services-less Android

Copyright (c) 2020 Proton Technologies AG

## About

this is a fork of a fork of the ProtonMail Android app.

the original fork adds functionality to display notifications without Google Play Services. yep, I am aware it is just a proof of concept, but it works like a charm.

this fork sets the background sync time to 4 minutes. this may lead to increased battery usage, but I have not noticed any major impact on my phone at least.

## Setup

The most straightforward way to build and run this application is to:

- Install Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio/install
- Clone the repository. You have two options:
	- Use the `Project from version control` in Android Studio, or
	- Use the `git clone` command and import it into Android Studio
- Build and run the app directly in Android Studio

Alternatively, if you want to build the app directly from the command line (or using a different IDE, etc.), you will first need to install the command line tools from: https://developer.android.com/studio#cmdline-tools. Then you will need to install the SDK using the `sdkmanager` tool. After cloning the repository with `git clone` you will need to edit the `local.properties` file so that it points to the location of the SDK. Depending on which operating systems you use, the location of the SDK is usually:

- Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Android\sdk`
- MacOS: `/Users/<username>/Library/Android/Sdk/`
- Linux: `/Users/<username>/Android/Sdk/`

Then, go to the appâ€™s root directory in the command line tool and run:

- `./gradlew assembleBetaDebug`
- `adb install ./app/build/outputs/apk/beta/debug/ProtonMail-Android-1.XX.X-beta-debug.apk`
